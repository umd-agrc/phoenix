# Rotocrawler
This project’s aim is to develop a autonomous, self-tuning navigation system for a robotic platform using an artificial neural network. The robotic platform being designed for this project has the functionality of a micro-aerial vehicle (i.e., MAV or “drone”) and a quadruped crawling robot– meaning that it can both walk and fly depending on the environmental context and its specified goal. The autonomous, self-tuning navigation system uses an optimized schedule for flight and crawl pairing, given a context and goal. The choice of an autonomous navigator alleviates the operator from having to consider or maintain awareness of a large number of sensor or heuristic vehicle state.
